📘 JavaScript – Core Concepts & Properties
🔹 1. Interpreted Language
JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning the code is executed line-by-line at runtime by the JavaScript engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome).

c++ code is first compiled then run on your machine
✅ Upsides:
No compilation step required before running your code.

Great for quick prototyping and debugging.

❌ Downsides:
Slower performance compared to compiled languages.(performance overhead)

More prone to runtime errors, since many issues only appear when the code is executed.(thats why typescript came...)

What is Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation?
JIT is a hybrid approach.

JavaScript engines like V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js) and SpiderMonkey (Firefox) compile JavaScript into machine code at runtime, just before it's executed.

This provides the flexibility of an interpreted language and the speed of a compiled one.

✅ So, is JavaScript interpreted or compiled?
Originally, JavaScript was interpreted.

Modern JavaScript is JIT compiled, which means:

It's not purely interpreted anymore.

It's not compiled ahead-of-time (AOT) like C++.

It's compiled at runtime for performance





🔹 2. Dynamically Typed
In JavaScript, variables are not tied to a specific data type. Their type is determined at runtime and can change during execution.

Example:
cpp
Copy
Edit 
// ❌ C++ Code (will not compile)
int a = 1;
a = "hello";   // Error
a = true;      // Error
js
Copy
Edit
// ✅ JavaScript Code (valid)
var a = 1;
a = "harkirat";
a = true;

console.log(a); // true
⚠️ Implications:
Flexibility while coding.

But also more bugs due to unexpected type changes.

🔹 3. Single-Threaded
JavaScript runs in a single-threaded environment, which means it processes one task at a time.

This design simplifies code execution but introduces challenges like:

Blocking operations

Need for asynchronous programming (e.g., promises, async/await)

We will dive deeper into the Event Loop and async behavior later.

🔹 4. Garbage Collected
JavaScript includes automatic memory management via garbage collection.

🔧 How it works:
The engine tracks objects in memory.

When no part of the code references an object, it is automatically freed.

✅ Benefits: 
No need to manually allocate/free memory.

Helps prevent memory leaks in most cases.

🧠 Conclusion: Is JavaScript a Good Language? 
Pros	Cons                                   
Beginner friendly	Slower than compiled languages
Widely used in web development	More runtime errors
Flexible & dynamic	Difficult to debug large applications
No need for manual memory mgmt	Weak typing can lead to bugs

🔧 Newer runtimes like Bun are working to optimize JS performance, but C++ or Rust still outperform JS for system-level or compute-heavy tasks.


/**
 * Ways to Add JavaScript in HTML – Notes
 *
 * 1. Inline JavaScript
 * - JavaScript written directly inside HTML attributes
 * - Example: onclick, onload
 * - Not recommended because it mixes HTML and JS
 *
 * Example:
 * <button onclick="alert('Hello')">Click</button>
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 2. Internal JavaScript
 * - JavaScript written inside <script> tag
 * - Present in the same HTML file
 * - Suitable only for small programs
 *
 * Example:
 * <script>
 *   console.log("Hello JS");
 * </script>
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 3. External JavaScript (Best Practice)
 * - JavaScript written in a separate .js file
 * - Linked using src attribute
 * - Clean, reusable, and maintainable
 *
 * Example:
 * <script src="app.js"></script>
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 4. Script Placement
 *
 * a) Inside <head>
 * - Can block HTML rendering
 *
 * b) Before </body> (Recommended)
 * - HTML loads first, then JS executes
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 5. defer Attribute
 * - Script loads in background
 * - Executes after HTML parsing
 * - Maintains execution order
 *
 * Example:
 * <script src="app.js" defer></script>
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 6. async Attribute
 * - Script loads and executes asynchronously
 * - Execution order not guaranteed
 * - Used for analytics or ads
 *
 * Example:
 * <script src="app.js" async></script>
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Summary:
 * - Inline JS: Not recommended
 * - Internal JS: Small projects
 * - External JS: Best practice
 * - defer: Safest and preferred
 * - async: Special use cases


 👉 There is NO fixed priority like:
❌ inline > internal > external

👉 Actual order = top to bottom HTML parsing order

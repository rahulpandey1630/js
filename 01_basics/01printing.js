// JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 in just 10 days, first called Mocha.
// It was renamed to LiveScript, then JavaScript for marketing; Microsoft made JScript for Internet Explorer.
// Due to differences, both were standardized by ECMA in 1997 as ECMAScript.
//1997-ES1 ES5(2009 BIG CHANGES) ES6(KNOWN MODERN JS CAME IN 2015 HAD BIGGEST CHANGES)


// JavaScript is backward compatible, meaning old code works in modern browsers.
// It is not forward compatible, so new features may not work in older browsers like Internet Explorer.
// Browsers support older syntax but cannot run future features they don't recognize.
//BABEL TOOL CAN TRANSPILE ES6 CODE TO ES5 SO THAT THEY CAN WORK ON OLD BROWSERS

 Web Development â€“ Key Concepts
ðŸ”¹ What Do Browsers Understand?
A web browser can only understand the following core technologies:

Language	Purpose
HTML	Structure/content of the web page
CSS	Styling/appearance of the content
JavaScript	Interactivity and logic
WebAssembly (Wasm)	High-performance compiled code (optional)

âœ… Important: No matter what framework or tool you use, the browser eventually receives HTML, CSS, and JS.

ðŸ”¹ What Makes Up a Website?
Any website you use is essentially made up of:

HTML files â†’ Layout and structure

CSS files â†’ Styling (colors, fonts, layout)

JavaScript files â†’ Logic and interactions

Assets â†’ Images, videos, fonts, icons, etc.

ðŸŽ¯ These files are served to the browser and are interpreted/rendered to form the visual website.

ðŸ”¹ Frameworks like React / Next.js
React, Next.js, Vue, etc., are JavaScript frameworks/libraries.

They make it easier to build complex apps by:

Managing UI state

Organizing code

Routing between pages

Optimizing performance

ðŸ§  But in the end:

React and others compile (or "transpile") into plain HTML, CSS, and JS.

Your browser never sees "React code" directly â€” only the result of it.

ðŸ”¹ Why Canâ€™t Browsers Run C++ Code?
Your C++ code (e.g., on LeetCode) doesnâ€™t run inside the browser.

Instead, it's sent to a remote server, compiled and executed there.

The result/output is returned to your browser.

ðŸ›‘ Browsers cannot natively compile C++, Java, Python, etc.

ðŸ”¹ What Is WebAssembly (Wasm)?
WebAssembly (Wasm) is a low-level binary format.

It allows languages like C++, Rust, and Go to run in the browser.

You write C++ â†’ compile it to .wasm â†’ browser runs that wasm.

ðŸ”§ This is how you can technically run C++/Rust code in a browser â€” but only after converting it to WebAssembly.

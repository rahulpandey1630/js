The image explains how the fetch function works in JavaScript, particularly in the context of Promises and network requests.

Breakdown of the Image:
fetch('something')

This initiates a network request and returns a Promise.
Storage in Global Memory

The response variable is declared in global memory, but it does not immediately hold the actual response data.
Instead, it holds a Promise object.
Network Request Process

The request is sent to either a Web Browser or Node.js (depending on the environment).
The browser or Node.js handles the request asynchronously.
Promise States

The Promise will have two possible states:
✅ Fulfilled (Success) → The response is stored in the onFulfilled[] queue.
❌ Rejected (Failure) → The error is stored in the onRejection[] queue.
Handling the Response

Once the request completes successfully, the Promise resolves, and the data is processed.
Key Takeaways:
fetch() is asynchronous and returns a Promise.
The response isn't immediately available; it is handled via .then() or async/await.
Errors must be handled explicitly using .catch().

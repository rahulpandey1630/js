//JSON FORMATTER TO READ JSON FILE API'S


// XHR (XMLHttpRequest):
// - XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is a JavaScript object used to interact with servers.
// - It allows the client (browser) to make HTTP/HTTPS requests to a server without reloading the page.
// - Often used for AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

// Features of XHR:
// - Can send requests and receive responses asynchronously or synchronously.
// - Supports HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
// - Can handle various data formats (JSON, XML, plain text, etc.).
// - Enables partial updates to web pages without requiring a full page reload.

// Syntax to Create an XHR Object:
//const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Creates a new XHR instance.

// Key Properties of XHR:
// 1. xhr.readyState:
//    - Tracks the state of the request.
//    - Possible values:
//      0: UNSENT - Client has been created. open() not called yet.
//      1: OPENED - open() has been called.
//      2: HEADERS_RECEIVED - send() has been called; headers and status available.
//      3: LOADING - Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
//      4: DONE - The operation is complete.

// 2. xhr.responseText:
//    - Contains the response data as a string (for text-based responses).

// 3. xhr.status:
//    - Contains the HTTP status code of the response (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).

// 4. xhr.onreadystatechange:
//    - An event handler that is called whenever the readyState changes
   /* XHR vs Fetch: Key Points
Syntax:

XHR: Verbose and callback-based.
Fetch: Clean, promise-based, and modern.
Error Handling:

XHR: Manually check status and readyState.
Fetch: Use .catch(), but check response.ok for HTTP errors.
JSON Parsing:

XHR: Requires JSON.parse().
Fetch: Built-in .json() method.
Streaming:

XHR: No support for streaming.
Fetch: Supports modern streaming features.
Browser Support:

XHR: Works in old and new browsers.
Fetch: Supported in modern browsers, but not in older ones like IE.
Recommendation: Use fetch for modern applications; fall back to XHR for legacy browser support.

    // The URL for the API request (GitHub API endpoint for user data)
    const requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/hiteshchoudhary';

    // Create a new instance of XMLHttpRequest
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    // open() initializes the request
    // Syntax: xhr.open(method, url)
    // - 'GET': Specifies the HTTP method for retrieving data
    // - requestUrl: The target API endpoint
    xhr.open('GET', requestUrl);

    // Define the event handler for the state change of the request
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
        // Logs the current `readyState` of the XMLHttpRequest object
        console.log(xhr.readyState);

        // When readyState is 4 (DONE), the response is fully received
        if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
            // Parse the JSON response text into a JavaScript object
            const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);

            // Log the type of the parsed data (should be 'object')
            console.log(typeof data);

            // Log the number of followers from the API response
            console.log(data.followers);
        }
    };

    // Sends the request to the server
    xhr.send();

///`console.log` is a part of JavaScript, specifically the `console` object.
// - The `console` object is built into the JavaScript environment provided by web browsers or Node.js.

    /*
        Explanation of Key Points in the Code:
        1. XMLHttpRequest (XHR):
           - Allows interaction with servers asynchronously without reloading the web page.
           - Used to fetch data from APIs or servers, such as retrieving user data.

        2. xhr.open(method, url):
           - Initializes the HTTP request.
           - Configures the HTTP method ('GET' or 'POST') and the target URL for the request.

        3. xhr.onreadystatechange:
           - An event listener that triggers whenever the `readyState` changes.
           - Used to track the progress of the request and handle responses accordingly.

        4. xhr.readyState:
           - Represents the current state of the XHR object.
           - Values:
               0 (UNSENT): Request created but not initialized.
               1 (OPENED): Request initialized with `open()`.
               2 (HEADERS_RECEIVED): Request sent, and headers are available.
               3 (LOADING): Response body is being downloaded.
               4 (DONE): Request is complete, and the response is ready.

        5. xhr.responseText:
           - Contains the full response body as a text string.
           - Used to access server responses (like JSON, HTML, or plain text).

        6. JSON.parse():
           - Converts JSON strings into JavaScript objects.
           - Enables access to structured data from the server.

        7. xhr.send():
           - Sends the initialized HTTP request to the server.
           - Completes the request lifecycle.

        Use Case for This Code:
        - Fetches GitHub user data (e.g., followers) from the API and logs it to the console.
        - Demonstrates how to use `XMLHttpRequest` for API communication.

        Suggested Improvements:
        - Use the modern `fetch()` API for better readability and cleaner code.
        - Add error handling for scenarios like network failures or invalid responses.

   // V8 Engine Overview:

   
// - The V8 Engine is an open-source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine developed by Google.
// - It powers JavaScript execution in Google Chrome, Node.js, and other applications.

// Key Features of the V8 Engine:
// 1. Written in C++ for high performance.
// 2. Compiles JavaScript directly into machine code for faster execution.
// 3. Manages memory efficiently using garbage collection.
// 4. Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for optimizing JavaScript code at runtime.
// 5. Fully supports modern ECMAScript standards and features.
// 6. Embeddable in other applications, enabling platforms like Node.js.

// V8 Architecture:
// 1. Parser:
//    - Converts JavaScript code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
//    - Validates syntax and prepares code for execution.
// 2. Ignition (Interpreter):
//    - Interprets JavaScript and converts it into bytecode.
//    - Executes bytecode quickly during the initial run.
// 3. TurboFan (JIT Compiler):
//    - Optimizes frequently executed bytecode into highly efficient machine code.
//    - Makes execution faster by analyzing code patterns.
// 4. Garbage Collector:
//    - Reclaims unused memory to prevent memory leaks.
//    - Uses algorithms like "Mark-and-Sweep" and "Generational Garbage Collection."

// Why is V8 Fast?
// - Compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code.
// - Performs runtime optimization of code.
// - Efficient memory management via garbage collection.

// Use Cases of the V8 Engine:
// 1. Google Chrome: Executes JavaScript for fast and efficient browsing.
// 2. Node.js: Enables server-side JavaScript with non-blocking I/O operations.
// 3. Electron Apps: Used in apps like Slack for building desktop applications with JavaScript.

// Example of V8 Execution Process:
// When you run the following JavaScript code:
function greet() {
    console.log('Hello, world!'); // Logs "Hello, world!" to the console
}
greet(); // Calls the greet function

// Execution Steps in V8:
// 1. The Parser converts the code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
// 2. Ignition converts the AST into bytecode for execution.
// 3. TurboFan optimizes the bytecode into highly efficient machine code based on execution patterns.
// 4. The optimized machine code runs, and "Hello, world!" is displayed on the console.

// Fun Fact:
// - The name "V8" is inspired by an 8-cylinder car engine, symbolizing speed and power.



API


// API (Application Programming Interface):
// - An API is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate and exchange data.
// - It defines how requests and responses should be structured between a client (like a browser) and a server or service.

// Types of APIs:
// 1. Web APIs:
//    - These are interfaces for communication over the internet using HTTP/HTTPS.
//    - Example: REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, SOAP APIs.
// 2. Operating System APIs:
//    - Provide access to OS-level functionalities like file management and device control.
// 3. Library APIs:
//    - Enable interaction with programming libraries (e.g., Python's NumPy, JavaScript's DOM API).

// Common Use Cases of APIs:
// - Fetching data from a server (e.g., retrieving weather data from a weather API).
// - Sending data to a server (e.g., submitting a form or creating a user account).
// - Enabling third-party integrations (e.g., payment gateways like Stripe).
// - Accessing device hardware (e.g., camera or GPS through browser APIs).

// Example of Using a Web API:
// The following example demonstrates how to fetch user data from a public API (GitHub API) using the Fetch API:

fetch('https://api.github.com/users/octocat') // URL of the API endpoint
    .then(response => response.json()) // Parses the response as JSON
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data); // Logs the fetched user data
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error); // Logs any errors during the fetch process
    });

// Key Concepts in APIs:
// 1. Endpoint:
//    - A specific URL provided by the API to perform a particular action (e.g., fetching data, creating resources).
// 2. Request:
//    - The message sent by the client to the server, containing method, headers, and optional data.
//    - HTTP Methods include:
//      - GET: Fetch data from the server.
//      - POST: Send data to create a resource on the server.
//      - PUT: Update an existing resource.
//      - DELETE: Remove a resource.
// 3. Response:
//    - The message sent by the server back to the client, containing status codes, headers, and optional data.
//    - Status codes example:
//      - 200: Success
//      - 404: Not Found
//      - 500: Server Error

// Benefits of APIs:
// - Simplify development by reusing functionalities.
// - Enable interoperability between different systems.
// - Improve scalability and flexibility of applications.

// Real-World Examples:
// - Login with Google or Facebook: Uses OAuth APIs for authentication.
// - Fetching live weather data: Uses weather APIs like OpenWeatherMap.
// - Payment integration: APIs like PayPal, Stripe, or Razorpay.
